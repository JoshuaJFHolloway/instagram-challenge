Instagram Challenge
===================

This challenge was to build my own version of Instagram using Rails. I decided to build instagram
which was made entirely of strange looking pictures of me and my face. Aptly named...Joshagram.


## Context

Challenge time: one weekend

What I focused on:

1. Users can post and caption pictures
2. Users can login and registration
3. Users can enjoy the user experience (sleek interface)


## How I approached this challenge

I decided that my MVP was what I outlined above. The third bullet point wouldn't usually be included in 
peoples MVP but I wanted to devote a significant portion of my time to CSS. Prior projects have looked more
like Microsoft Word as I have focused on pure functionality. As much as that is all well and good, I felt
that I needed to learn and practise some core CSS. I also wanted to learn bootstrap and paperclip gem usage
and have some cool CSS features like on hover buttons and navigation bars!

Alas, after deciding on the aforementioned MVP, I worked on them in number order. It made most sense to me
to firstly work out the pages I'll need to create with rails. These would be the index page where posts
are viewed and a submission page where the pictures are submitted. After this, I worked on having relationships
between tables of data. Most importantly between user accounts and the pictures they submit. Finally, I spent
a significant amount of time on formatting the pages. 


## How to use
