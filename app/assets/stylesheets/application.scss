 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files

 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, or any plugin's
 * vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any other CSS/SCSS
 * files in this directory. Styles in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.
 * It is generally better to create a new file per style scope.
 *


 * This file is .SCSS so that it is bootstrap enabled.

/* Added bootstrap within gemfiles and bundle installed but these two lines enable it.
This is the reference for bootstrap to enable its formatting on all
the classes in the erb forms. Also added "font-awesome" so that I can access their icons to use in my css.
